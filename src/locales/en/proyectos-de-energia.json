We accompany our clients in the preparation of financial models for the evaluation of their long-term projects, as well as in the evaluation and design of funding alternatives based on the characteristics of each project, to achieve adequate fundraising by institutional investors, public or private. We provide support for participation in government bids and auctions, as well as in joint infrastructure development processes, so that from the beginning all the fiscal considerations of the corresponding project are taken into account."}
